- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hurshal
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... Art, Soccer/Football and a lot of other little things, including coding!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Python, as well as HTML5 and CSS3. I'm also planning to learn JavaScript, React and Java.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... My public Instagram is my art account, @i.can_draww_ -- other than that, I dont have any public social media.
                           Feel free to contact me over non-art related things, though!
